                  During ancient times, Parvati Devi came here to overcome her
                  grief and despondency, performing meditation and austerities. As
                  a result, she was granted the divine vision of Sri Chaitanya’s
                  transcendental beauty. Overwhelmed with devotion, she placed the
                  dust of His lotus feet on the central part of her
                  hair—simanta—giving this island its name.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
                  In Satya-yuga, Lord Shiva revealed a great secret to his
                  consort, Parvati. She had observed his ecstatic chanting of the
                  name Gaura and his blissful dancing, and she inquired about the
                  reason for his joy. Lord Shiva then spoke of the future advent
                  of Sri Chaitanya in Navadvipa, describing how the
                  golden-complexioned Lord would chant the Holy Names and spread
                  devotion and divine love throughout the world. He explained that
                  only the most unfortunate would fail to drown in this ocean of
                  bliss. Even Mahadev himself could not contain his ecstasy upon
                  hearing Sri Chaitanya’s name. Finally, he resolved to leave
                  Kashi and come to Mayapur to engage in devotional service.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
                  Hearing this revelation, Parvati Devi was also inspired to
                  travel to Navadvipa. She arrived with great eagerness to offer
                  obeisances to the Supreme Lord in His divine form as Sri
                  Chaitanya and performed austerities to obtain His mercy. In due
                  course, her devotion was rewarded—she was blessed with the
                  vision of Sri Chaitanya. Overcome with ecstasy, she fell at His
                  lotus feet and reverently placed their dust upon her forehead.

                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    One day, Sri Chaitanya understood that Nityananda had arrived
                    in Navadvip. Overwhelmed with joy, He urged His devotees to
                    find Him. But no one knew whom He was speaking about.

                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Gathering His associates, Chaitanya shared a dream He had the
                    night before:
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    "I saw a chariot stop before my house, carrying an
                    extraordinary personality. He wore blue cloth, a turban, and a
                    single dazzling earring. A club rested on His shoulder, and a
                    kamandalu pot hung from His stick. The moment I saw Him, I
                    felt He was my brother—Balaram."
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    "He asked repeatedly, ‘Is this the house of Nimai Pandit?’
                    Though I had never seen Him before, I was drawn to Him with
                    deep reverence. I asked, ‘Who are You?’ He smiled and said, ‘I
                    am Your brother. Tomorrow, we shall meet.’
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    "I believe a great soul has arrived in Navadvip. Haridas!
                    Shrivas! Go find Him at once."
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Haridas Thakur and Shrivas Pandit searched everywhere but
                    found no one like the person Chaitanya described. After nine
                    hours, they returned, exhausted: "We searched every corner of
                    Navadvip but could not find Him."
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Chaitanya smiled. "Nityananda is the embodiment of Sri Guru.
                    He cannot be found unless Bhagavan Himself reveals Him."
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Then, with all His devotees, Chaitanya set out in search of
                    Nityananda. Chanting “Haribol! Haribol!”, they arrived at
                    Nandana Acharya’s house.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    There, they saw Him. A divine jewel among men—lost in deep
                    meditation, effulgent like a million suns. The moment
                    Chaitanya beheld Him, He recognized His eternal brother,
                    Balarama. Nityananda, too, saw His Lord.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Stunned with ecstasy, He gazed at Chaitanya with unwavering
                    devotion—as if drinking Him with His eyes, smelling Him with
                    His nose, embracing Him with His very soul. He stood
                    motionless, silent.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Understanding this divine moment, Chaitanya asked Srivasa to
                    recite a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (10.21.5):
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    "Wearing a peacock-feather ornament upon His head, blue
                    karnikara flowers on His ears, a golden-yellow garment, and
                    the Vaijayanti garland, Lord Krishna entered Vrindavan,
                    filling the forest with the nectar of His flute…"
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Upon hearing this, Nityananda collapsed in divine ecstasy,
                    losing all external awareness. As Shrivas recited more and
                    more, His bliss intensified—He roared, tears streaming down
                    His face. The Lord and His brother had reunited.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">

                    Srila Bhakti Saranga Maharaj was a distinguished scholar, a
                    brilliant orator, and an exceptional preacher. His deep wisdom
                    and divine qualities made him a master at dispelling
                    misconceptions and defending the mission of Sri Chaitanya.
                    Recognizing his abilities, Srila Prabhupad often entrusted him
                    with clarifying doubts and upholding the integrity of the
                    Gaudiya mission—a task he fulfilled with great success.

                    Later, he became the editor of The Gaudiya magazine and was
                    sent to London to spread the message of Sri Chaitanya, where
                    his preaching made a lasting impact.

                    four-armed deity of Adhokshaja Vishnu, discovered during the

                    essence to sincere devotees. The Shiva-lingam worshipped here
                    was originally discovered near Shiva-doba, adjacent to Vriddha
                    Shiva-ghat, and now resides in Yogapith alongside a smaller
