                    During ancient times, Parvati Devi came here to overcome her grief
                    and despondency, performing meditation and austerities. As a
                    result, she was granted the divine vision of Sri Chaitanya’s
                    transcendental beauty. Overwhelmed with devotion, she placed the
                    dust of His lotus feet on the central part of her
                    hair—simanta—giving this island its name.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
                    In Satya-yuga, Lord Shiva revealed a great secret to his consort,
                    Parvati. She had observed his ecstatic chanting of the name Gaura
                    and his blissful dancing, and she inquired about the reason for
                    his joy. Lord Shiva then spoke of the future advent of Sri
                    Chaitanya in Navadvipa, describing how the golden-complexioned
                    Lord would chant the Holy Names and spread devotion and divine
                    love throughout the world. He explained that only the most
                    unfortunate would fail to drown in this ocean of bliss. Even
                    Mahadev himself could not contain his ecstasy upon hearing Sri
                    Chaitanya’s name. Finally, he resolved to leave Kashi and come to
                    Mayapur to engage in devotional service.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
                    Hearing this revelation, Parvati Devi was also inspired to travel
                    to Navadvipa. She arrived with great eagerness to offer obeisances
                    to the Supreme Lord in His divine form as Sri Chaitanya and
                    performed austerities to obtain His mercy. In due course, her
                    devotion was rewarded—she was blessed with the vision of Sri
                    Chaitanya. Overcome with ecstasy, she fell at His lotus feet and
                    reverently placed their dust upon her forehead.

                      originally discovered near a place called Shiva-Doba, adjacent
                      to Vrddha Shiva Ghat. Today, this linga resides in Yogapith
