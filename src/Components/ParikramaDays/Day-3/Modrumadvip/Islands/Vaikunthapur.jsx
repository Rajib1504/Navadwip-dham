              Vaikunthapur is a sacred village on the northern outskirts of
              Navadvip, representing the highest transcendental realityâ€”the
              spiritual kingdom of Narayana, which lies beyond the Viraja River.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Here, Bhagavan is eternally present, worshiped in all His splendor
              and surrounded by His three divine energies: Bhu, Lila, and Sri.
              The effulgence of Brahman, which emanates from Bhagavan, is merely
              a reflection of these transcendental realities.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              It is said that after visiting Vaikuntha, Narada Muni realized
              that Bhagavan was also present in the holy land of Navadvip. Drawn
              by this revelation, he came to this sacred place, where Narayana
              appeared before him and granted him divine darshan. As Narada
              worshiped Him, Bhagavan mercifully revealed His form as Sri
              Chaitanya, demonstrating His connection to the pastimes of
              Navadvip.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Narada remained in Vaikunthapur for some time, deeply engaged in
              the worship. His devotion sanctified the area, and since then,
              this place has been known as Vaikunthapur.
