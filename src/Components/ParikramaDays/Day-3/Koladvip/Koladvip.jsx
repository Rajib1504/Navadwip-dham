                During ancient times, Parvati Devi came here to overcome her
                grief and despondency, performing meditation and austerities. As
                a result, she was granted the divine vision of Sri Chaitanya’s
                transcendental beauty. Overwhelmed with devotion, she placed the
                dust of His lotus feet on the central part of her
                hair—simanta—giving this island its name.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
                In Satya-yuga, Lord Shiva revealed a great secret to his
                consort, Parvati. She had observed his ecstatic chanting of the
                name Gaura and his blissful dancing, and she inquired about the
                reason for his joy. Lord Shiva then spoke of the future advent
                of Sri Chaitanya in Navadvipa, describing how the
                golden-complexioned Lord would chant the Holy Names and spread
                devotion and divine love throughout the world. He explained that
                only the most unfortunate would fail to drown in this ocean of
                bliss. Even Mahadev himself could not contain his ecstasy upon
                hearing Sri Chaitanya’s name. Finally, he resolved to leave
                Kashi and come to Mayapur to engage in devotional service.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
                Hearing this revelation, Parvati Devi was also inspired to
                travel to Navadvipa. She arrived with great eagerness to offer
                obeisances to the Supreme Lord in His divine form as Sri
                Chaitanya and performed austerities to obtain His mercy. In due
                course, her devotion was rewarded—she was blessed with the
                vision of Sri Chaitanya. Overcome with ecstasy, she fell at His
                lotus feet and reverently placed their dust upon her forehead.

                  This sacred place is considered non-different from Dvaraka and
                  associated with Ganga Sagar. In ancient times, a pious king
                  named Samudrasen ruled this land and became renowned for his
                  devotion to Sri Krishna.

                  During this period, Bhima, one of the five Pandavas, arrived
                  to collect tribute on behalf of Maharaj Yudhishthira. Known
                  for his strength, Bhima would challenge any kingdom that
                  refused to pay. However, King Samudrasen, aware of Bhima’s
                  deep devotion to Sri Krishna, saw an opportunity to meet Sri
                  Krishna by engaging Bhima in battle.

                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  A fierce fight ensued, with the king displaying remarkable
                  strength and determination—so much so that Bhima began to fear
                  defeat and dishonor. Seeking help, he prayed to Sri Krishna.
                  Responding to Bhima’s plea and wishing to pacify Samudrasen’s
                  resolve, Sri Krishna appeared before the king in His original
                  form, adorned with yellow garments and brilliant jewels.

                  Overjoyed, the king revealed his long-cherished desire to see
                  Krishna in His Vrindavan pastimes. However, bound by his vow
                  to remain in Navadvip, he had been unable to do so. He eagerly
                  requested Krishna to reveal the form He would assume in His
                  future incarnation.

                  Hearing the king’s heartfelt plea, Sri Krishna first granted
                  him visions of His Vrindavan pastimes, including His divine
                  sports with Srimati Radharani and the gopis in Kumudvan
                  forest. Then, He revealed His radiant form as Sri
                  Chaitanya—immersed in the ecstatic chanting of the Holy Name,
                  surrounded by His loving associates.

                  Overwhelmed with bliss, the king offered prayers of
                  glorification. But suddenly, Bhagavan disappeared from his
                  vision, leaving him grief-stricken and tormented by
                  separation.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Unaware of the divine encounter, Bhima misinterpreted the
                  king’s tears as a sign of fear and launched a full-force
                  attack. In the end, King Samudrasen submitted to Bhima and
                  paid the required tribute, allowing Bhima to fulfill his
                  mission.

                  Ganga Sagar is the sacred confluence where the Ganga River
                  meets the ocean. According to ancient accounts, a dialogue
                  once took place between the personified Ganga and the ocean.
                  The ocean praised Ganga for her unparalleled fortune, as Sri
                  Chaitanya Bhagavan himself had bathed in her waters.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  In response, Ganga expressed her sorrow, lamenting that Sri
                  Chaitanya would soon leave her and journey to Nilachal
                  (Jagannath Puri), situated on the ocean’s shore. Hearing this,
                  the ocean reassured Ganga, explaining that Sri Chaitanya never
                  truly leaves His eternal abode, Navadvip Dham, even if it
                  appears so to the external eye. The ocean then revealed his
                  deep longing to remain near Ganga and continuously serve
                  Navadvip.

                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  To this day, it is said that the ocean remains at this sacred

                  pastimes.

                  In a conversation between Shrinivas Acharya and Ishan Thakur,
                  Ishan recounted the story of a great devotee of Sri Krishna—an
                  elderly brahman who lived in Satya-yuga. This brahman
                  worshiped Bhagavan with champaka flowers, offering them with
                  deep devotion while meditating on the golden form that
                  Bhagavan would assume in the future. Though his heart was
                  filled with devotion, he was also sorrowful, knowing he would
                  not personally witness this golden form.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Moved by the brahman’s pure devotion, Sri Krishna Bhagavan
                  appeared before him in His effulgent golden form as Sri
                  Chaitanya, radiating the beauty of champaka flowers. Bhagavan
                  informed the brahman that in the age of Kali, He would descend
                  in this golden form to distribute the unconditional love of
                  Godhead and inspire all to chant the Holy Names. He also
                  assured the brahman that he would take birth again to witness
                  these divine pastimes.

                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Overwhelmed with ecstasy, the brahman glorified the champaka
                  flowers for their great fortune. From that moment, the place
                  became known as Champakhatta. In his next life, this brahman
                  was known as Dvija Vaninath, the younger brother of Gadadhar
                  Pandit.

                  associates, once performed congregational chanting of the Holy
                  Name during a festival at His home. Today, a temple stands
                  here, housing the deities of Sri Sri Gaura-Gadadhara, which
                  Dvija Vaninath personally worshiped over 500 years ago.
                  Devotees from the Gaudiya Math, established by Srila
                  Prabhupad, continue to serve these deities today.

                  According to Nityananda Prabhu’s explanations to Sri Jiva
                  Goswami, this area was once home to a beautiful garden of
                  champaka flowers, part of Khadiravan Forest. The gopi
                  Champakalata would gather flowers from here to make garlands,
                  which she offered to Sri Sri Radha-Krishna.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  In the age of Kali, this garden became a place where local
                  gardeners collected champaka flowers and sold them, leading to
                  the establishment of a bustling market, or “hatta.” As a
                  result, the area became known as Champakhatta, later
                  simplified to Champahatti.
