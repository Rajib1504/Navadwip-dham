              After Indra became angry with the residents of Vrindavan for
              worshiping Govardhan Hill instead of him, he sent torrential rains
              to devastate the land. However, realizing his mistake, he came to
              this sacred site on the banks of the Saraswati River, accompanied
              by the divine cow Surabhi, to seek forgiveness from Sri Krishna.
              Here, he performed worship as an act of atonement.

              This place is also where Markandeya Rishi performed intense bhajan
              during the great flood and received the mercy of Sri Chaitanya.

              Today, Surabhi-kunja remains a revered pilgrimage site. A Gaudiya

              Radha-Krishna are worshiped with devotion.
