                During ancient times, Parvati Devi came here to overcome her
                grief and despondency, performing meditation and austerities. As
                a result, she was granted the divine vision of Sri Chaitanya’s
                transcendental beauty. Overwhelmed with devotion, she placed the
                dust of His lotus feet on the central part of her
                hair—simanta—giving this island its name.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
                In Satya-yuga, Lord Shiva revealed a great secret to his
                consort, Parvati. She had observed his ecstatic chanting of the
                name Gaura and his blissful dancing, and she inquired about the
                reason for his joy. Lord Shiva then spoke of the future advent
                of Sri Chaitanya in Navadvipa, describing how the
                golden-complexioned Lord would chant the Holy Names and spread
                devotion and divine love throughout the world. He explained that
                only the most unfortunate would fail to drown in this ocean of
                bliss. Even Mahadev himself could not contain his ecstasy upon
                hearing Sri Chaitanya’s name. Finally, he resolved to leave
                Kashi and come to Mayapur to engage in devotional service.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
                Hearing this revelation, Parvati Devi was also inspired to
                travel to Navadvipa. She arrived with great eagerness to offer
                obeisances to the Supreme Lord in His divine form as Sri
                Chaitanya and performed austerities to obtain His mercy. In due
                course, her devotion was rewarded—she was blessed with the
                vision of Sri Chaitanya. Overcome with ecstasy, she fell at His
                lotus feet and reverently placed their dust upon her forehead.

                To the south of the village of Marjida, the Gomati River flows gracefully, its banks home to the sacred site of Naimisharanya. This revered place is renowned for the unique deity of Hamsa-vahana—Lord Shiva seated upon a swan, the celestial carrier of Brahma.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                The history of this site dates back to ancient times. During the age of Kali, as its influence grew, many great sages, led by Shaunaka Rishi, gathered at Naimisharanya to hear the Gaura-Bhagavata from the lips of Suta Goswami. Shiva, eager to attend this divine assembly, faced a delay due to his slow movement. Desiring a way to reach in time, he appealed to Brahma, who granted him his celestial swan. Seated upon it, Shiva swiftly arrived at Naimisharanya and participated in the transcendental discourse glorifying the pastimes of Sri Chaitanya.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                Upon hearing the Gaura-Bhagavata, Shiva was overcome with ecstasy, and along with his associates, he began to chant the Holy Name of Sri Chaitanya. In a state of rapture, they showered flowers upon him, celebrating his devotion.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                A unique tradition of this temple is its annual festival, during which the Shiva-linga deity is bathed continuously for three days to prevent overheating. This phenomenon is attributed to Shiva’s intense desire to see Sri Chaitanya. In ancient times, to cool the deity, it was immersed in the sacred waters of the Gomati River.

                  In Satya-yuga, there lived a brahman named Jivan Das who had
                  renounced his home to embark on a pilgrimage. During his
                  journey, he reached Navadvip, where a sage appeared to him in
                  a dream. The sage instructed him to stay in Navadvip to attain
                  devotion for Bhagavan, emphasizing that this is the ultimate
                  goal of life. Following this divine guidance, Jivan Das built
                  a small hut and dedicated himself to the path of devotion for
                  the rest of his life.

                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  As he grew older, Jivan Das remembered his deep desire to live
                  in Pushkar Tirtha. However, his advanced age made it
                  impossible for him to travel there, and this filled him with
                  sadness.sensing his distress, the personified Pushkar Tirtha
                  appeared before him in the form of a brahman and instructed
                  him to bathe in a pond located in front of his house. By doing
                  so, Jivan Das would experience the spiritual essence of
                  Pushkar Tirtha.

                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Following the brahmana’s advice, Jivan Das bathed in the pond
                  and was blessed with a divine vision of Pushkar Tirtha.
                  Overcome with bliss, he listened as the personified Pushkar
                  explained that all the holy places are eternally present in
                  the sacred land of Navadvip. The brahman declared, “We all
                  reside here eternally, serving this holy place.” He further
                  revealed that Sri Chaitanya would appear in Kali-yuga, along
                  with His associates, to bestow the bliss of divine love upon
                  all.

                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  The brahman explained that even the most fallen sinner could
                  attain love of God by worshiping Sri Chaitanya in Navadvip. He
                  urged Jivan Das to continue practicing devotional service in
                  this sacred land to receive the special mercy of Sri
                  Chaitanya.

                Ucchahatt is a sacred place non-different from Kurukshetra of Brahmavarta, the divine land stretching between the Yamuna and the Ganga. Within this part of Madhyadvip, all the holy places of Brahmavarta are said to be present. 
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                The name “Ucchahatt” derives from the joyful market (hatt) of glorifications offered by the Gods and Goddesses, led by Indra, in honor of Sri Chaitanya and His divine pastimes.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                It is said that Sri Chaitanya Himself, accompanied by His associates, visited this place to blissfully chant the Holy Names. Situated on the border of Navadvip, Ucchahatt holds immense spiritual potency. The merit of residing in Kurukshetra for a hundred years can be attained by staying here for just one day. Simply visiting this sacred site bestows the priceless treasure of love of God.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                Even today, fortunate souls may still hear the celestial music and prayers offered by the Gods and Goddesses to Sri Chaitanya, resonating in the air of this holy land.

                Panchaveni, meaning “five rivers,” is the confluence of five sacred streams: three branches of the Ganga—Bhagirathi, Mandakini, and Alakananda—along with the Yamuna and the unmanifested Saraswati. This sacred site is also referred to as Maha-Prayag by saintly persons and sages.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                In ancient times, Brahma and great saintly personalities performed millions of fire sacrifices at this very spot. According to Navadvip-Bhava-Taranga, the waters of Panchaveni hold unparalleled sanctity, as Sri Chaitanya and His associates bathed here, purifying the waters by absorbing the immense sins of the world.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                It is said that anyone who bathes in Panchaveni will be liberated from the cycle of birth and death, never again returning to the material world. Even great scholars such as Vedavyasa affirm that no place is more sacred than Panchaveni.
