                During ancient times, Parvati Devi came here to overcome her
                grief and despondency, performing meditation and austerities. As
                a result, she was granted the divine vision of Sri Chaitanya’s
                transcendental beauty. Overwhelmed with devotion, she placed the
                dust of His lotus feet on the central part of her
                hair—simanta—giving this island its name.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
                In Satya-yuga, Lord Shiva revealed a great secret to his
                consort, Parvati. She had observed his ecstatic chanting of the
                name Gaura and his blissful dancing, and she inquired about the
                reason for his joy. Lord Shiva then spoke of the future advent
                of Sri Chaitanya in Navadvipa, describing how the
                golden-complexioned Lord would chant the Holy Names and spread
                devotion and divine love throughout the world. He explained that
                only the most unfortunate would fail to drown in this ocean of
                bliss. Even Mahadev himself could not contain his ecstasy upon
                hearing Sri Chaitanya’s name. Finally, he resolved to leave
                Kashi and come to Mayapur to engage in devotional service.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
                Hearing this revelation, Parvati Devi was also inspired to
                travel to Navadvipa. She arrived with great eagerness to offer
                obeisances to the Supreme Lord in His divine form as Sri
                Chaitanya and performed austerities to obtain His mercy. In due
                course, her devotion was rewarded—she was blessed with the
                vision of Sri Chaitanya. Overcome with ecstasy, she fell at His
                lotus feet and reverently placed their dust upon her forehead.

                  Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur shares an incredible story from the
                  17th century about the hidden pastimes of Lord Jagannath in
                  Navadvip.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Back then, a ruthless king named Raktabahu roamed Bharata,
                  destroying temples wherever he went. One day, he set his
                  sights on Jagannath Puri, planning to desecrate the sacred
                  shrine. The devotees, terrified for their beloved Lord, prayed
                  for protection.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  That night, Lord Jagannath appeared in a dream to the head
                  priest, reassuring him that everything was unfolding according
                  to His divine will. He instructed them to secretly move the
                  Deities through the jungle to Bengal, avoiding the main roads.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  The Sabaras, a tribe of devoted worshippers of Lord Jagannath,
                  took on this sacred mission. Carrying the Deities through
                  dense forests, they eventually reached Simantadvip, also
                  called Saradanga.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  There, Lord Jagannath again appeared in a dream and expressed
                  His desire to stay in that very place. Overjoyed, the Sabaras
                  built a simple temple and continued their worship for many
                  years. Though the original Deities and temple have since
                  vanished, the Sabara village still stands, a silent witness to
                  this divine pastime.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Centuries later, during the time of Sri Chaitanya, there lived
                  a great devotee named Jagadish Ganguli. He regularly traveled
                  to Jagannath Puri for the annual Ratha Yatra festival, where
                  he was blessed with the association of Sri Chaitanya. However,
                  due to illness, Jagadish lost his sight and was no longer able
                  to visit Puri. Saddened by this misfortune, he prayed
                  intensely to Lord Jagannath.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  One night, Lord Jagannath appeared to Jagadish in a dream and
                  instructed him to bathe in the Ganges the following morning.
                  The Lord assured him that a floating log would touch his body
                  during the bath, restoring his vision. Jagadisa was also told
                  to take the log to a leprous carpenter and have him carve a
                  deity of Lord Jagannath.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  As foretold, Jagadish regained his sight when the log touched
                  him during his bath. However, the carpenter initially refused
                  to carve the deity due to the painful wounds on his hands
                  caused by leprosy. Upon learning that he would be cured upon
                  completing the work, the carpenter agreed to undertake the
                  task. Although carving the deity caused him great discomfort,
                  his disease miraculously vanished as soon as the work was
                  completed.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Following Lord Jagannatha’s instructions, the same carpenter
                  later carved the Deities of Balarama and Subhadra. The three
                  Deities were installed and worshipped with great devotion.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Over time, however, the descendants of Jagadish Ganguli
                  committed grave offenses during the worship of the Deities. As
                  a result, the Lord cursed them with a disease, leading to the
                  decline of their family and the eventual desolation of their
                  village. The temple was abandoned and lost in the jungle.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Many years later, a young man named Jamini from a nearby
                  village had a divine dream in which Lord Jagannath instructed
                  him to resume His worship. Guided by the dream, Jamini and the
                  villagers cleared the jungle and rediscovered the Deities,
                  safe and untouched, hidden within an anthill.

                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  By the Lord’s mercy, worship was reestablished, and to this
                  day, the Deities are beautifully served according to the
                  strict standards introduced

                  Just southwest of the Jagannath temple, on the border between
                  Simantadvipa and Antardvipa, lies a special place—Sridhar
                  Angan. It sits by the Jalangi (Saraswati) River and holds
                  memories of one of Sri Chaitanya’s dearest devotees, Kalavecha
                  Sridhar.

                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Kalavecha Sridhar led a simple life in a dilapidated hut,
                  earning a living by selling banana leaves and vegetables. Half
                  of his meager earnings went directly to worshiping Ganga Devi.
                  Sri Chaitanya often visited to bargain with Sridhar, demanding
                  vegetables at half price, teasing and testing the patience of
                  His devotee.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  This place became even more special after Sri Chaitanya
                  defeated Chand Kazi. On His way back, He stopped here to rest,
                  making it a Vishram-sthali, a “resting place,” just like the
                  one in Mathura. It’s said that right here, Sri Chaitanya drank
                  water from Sridhar’s cracked iron pot—a moment that shows how
                  much He cherished His devotee’s love over wealth or grandeur.

                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Like many sacred spots in Navadvip, Sridhar Angan is adorned
                  with beautiful ponds (kundas). It is believed that
                  Vishvakarma, the celestial architect, created these ponds,
                  knowing that Sri Chaitanya and His devotees would chant the
                  Holy Name here day and night. He wanted to ensure that
                  Chaitanya and all His associates always had cool, refreshing
                  water.

                  This place is also considered non-different from Talavan, one
                  of Vrindavan’s twelve forests. Just as Lord Balaram killed the
                  demon Dhenukasura in Talavan, it is said that here in
                  Navadvip, He killed the demon Mayasura, further adding to the
                  sacredness of Sridhar Angan.

                  Chand Kazi’s samadhi is considered non-different from Mathura
                  because Chand Kazi himself is regarded as Kamsa in Krishna’s
                  pastimes.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Back in the day, Chand Kazi was the powerful administrator of
                  Navadvip, serving under the rule of Hossain Shah. He wasn’t
                  too pleased with the loud kirtans happening every night at
                  Srivas Angan. One day, he came there with his soldiers, broke
                  the devotees’ mridanga, and ordered them to stop chanting. But
                  that only set something much bigger in motion.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  Word spread fast, and Sri Chaitanya didn’t take it lightly. He
                  rallied the entire town for a massive sankirtan procession.
                  Thousands of people flooded the streets, singing and dancing
                  with unshakable determination. When they reached Kazi's house,
                  he was so shaken that he locked himself inside.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  But Sri Chaitanya, always merciful, called out to him,
                  assuring that no harm would come. He even addressed him as
                  “uncle,” softening the tension. Kazi finally stepped out and
                  revealed why he was so afraid.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  The night he had broken the mridanga, he had a terrifying
                  dream. A fierce, half-lion, half-man being sat on his chest,
                  warning him never to stop the chanting of the Holy Name
                  again—or else. When Kazi woke up, the creature’s claw marks
                  were still on his body, a chilling reminder that this was no
                  ordinary dream.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  That night changed everything. Realizing Sri Chaitanya’s
                  divine power, Chand Kazi surrendered, embracing the Gaudiya
                  philosophy along with his entire family.

                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                  His samadhi remains a sacred place to this day, and an ancient
                  champaka tree grows on top of it. What’s truly mysterious is
                  that even though the trunk is completely hollow, the tree
                  blooms all year round.

                Belvapaksha, also known as Belpukuriya, is often compared to Belavan forest in Vrindavan. 
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                Long ago, the brahmanas of this area worshipped Lord Shiva with great sincerity for two weeks, offering bel leaves and water. Pleased with their devotion, Lord Shiva granted them the highest blessing—not material wealth or power, but the priceless treasure of pure love for Sri Krishna. From this, the place got its name: Belva from the bel leaves and paksha meaning two weeks.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                But the story doesn’t end there. Lord Shiva appeared to one of the brahmanas named Nimbaditya and gave him a special instruction. Shiva directed him to the outskirts of the village, where a forest of bel trees stood. There, he would find his spiritual preceptors—the four Kumaras: Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana, and Sanat.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                Following these instructions, Nimbaditya reached the forest and saw the four Kumaras deep in meditation. Overcome with devotion, he began loudly chanting the Holy Names. The sages, hearing his heartfelt prayers, emerged from their meditation, joyfully embraced him, and welcomed him as their disciple.

                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                The Kumaras revealed a great truth to Nimbaditya. Just as Lakshmi Devi, Lord Brahma, and Lord Rudra had established their own spiritual lineages, he had been chosen to carry forward the path of pure devotion. They instructed him to bathe in the Ganges and, upon his return, initiated him into the sacred Radha-Krishna Yugala-mantra.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                In that sacred moment, something extraordinary happened. Pleased with his devotion, Sri Sri Radha-Krishna revealed their combined form as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Chaitanya then disclosed His divine identity—the unified form of Radha and Krishna—and made a prophecy. He foretold that in a future birth, Nimbaditya would be reborn as Keshava Kashmiri, a renowned scholar who would travel across Bharat, conquering great pundits in debate. Eventually, his journey would bring him to Navadvip, where he would meet Sri Chaitanya.
