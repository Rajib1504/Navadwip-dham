                    Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur shares an incredible story from the
                    17th century about the hidden pastimes of Lord Jagannath in
                    Navadvip.
                  </p>
                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Back then, a ruthless king named Raktabahu roamed Bharata,
                    destroying temples wherever he went. One day, he set his
                    sights on Jagannath Puri, planning to desecrate the sacred
                    shrine. The devotees, terrified for their beloved Lord, prayed
                    for protection.
                  </p>
                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    That night, Lord Jagannath appeared in a dream to the head
                    priest, reassuring him that everything was unfolding according
                    to His divine will. He instructed them to secretly move the
                    Deities through the jungle to Bengal, avoiding the main roads.
                  </p>
                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    The Sabaras, a tribe of devoted worshippers of Lord Jagannath,
                    took on this sacred mission. Carrying the Deities through
                    dense forests, they eventually reached Simantadvip, also
                    called Saradanga.
                  </p>
                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    There, Lord Jagannath again appeared in a dream and expressed
                    His desire to stay in that very place. Overjoyed, the Sabaras
                    built a simple temple and continued their worship for many
                    years. Though the original Deities and temple have since
                    vanished, the Sabara village still stands, a silent witness to
                    this divine pastime.
                  </p>
                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Centuries later, during the time of Sri Chaitanya, there lived
                    a great devotee named Jagadish Ganguli. He regularly traveled
                    to Jagannath Puri for the annual Ratha Yatra festival, where
                    he was blessed with the association of Sri Chaitanya. However,
                    due to illness, Jagadish lost his sight and was no longer able
                    to visit Puri. Saddened by this misfortune, he prayed
                    intensely to Lord Jagannath.
                  </p>
                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    One night, Lord Jagannath appeared to Jagadish in a dream and
                    instructed him to bathe in the Ganges the following morning.
                    The Lord assured him that a floating log would touch his body
                    during the bath, restoring his vision. Jagadisa was also told
                    to take the log to a leprous carpenter and have him carve a
                    deity of Lord Jagannath.
                  </p>
                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    As foretold, Jagadish regained his sight when the log touched
                    him during his bath. However, the carpenter initially refused
                    to carve the deity due to the painful wounds on his hands
                    caused by leprosy. Upon learning that he would be cured upon
                    completing the work, the carpenter agreed to undertake the
                    task. Although carving the deity caused him great discomfort,
                    his disease miraculously vanished as soon as the work was
                    completed.
                  </p>
                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Following Lord Jagannatha’s instructions, the same carpenter
                    later carved the Deities of Balarama and Subhadra. The three
                    Deities were installed and worshipped with great devotion.
                  </p>
                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Over time, however, the descendants of Jagadish Ganguli
                    committed grave offenses during the worship of the Deities. As
                    a result, the Lord cursed them with a disease, leading to the
                    decline of their family and the eventual desolation of their
                    village. The temple was abandoned and lost in the jungle.
                  </p>
                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    Many years later, a young man named Jamini from a nearby
                    village had a divine dream in which Lord Jagannath instructed
                    him to resume His worship. Guided by the dream, Jamini and the
                    villagers cleared the jungle and rediscovered the Deities,
                    safe and untouched, hidden within an anthill.

                  <p className="paragraph mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
                    By the Lord’s mercy, worship was reestablished, and to this
                    day, the Deities are beautifully served according to the
                    strict standards introduced
