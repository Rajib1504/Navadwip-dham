              During ancient times, Parvati Devi came here to overcome her grief
              and despondency, performing meditation and austerities. As a
              result, she was granted the divine vision of Sri Chaitanya’s
              transcendental beauty. Overwhelmed with devotion, she placed the
              dust of His lotus feet on the central part of her
              hair—simanta—giving this island its name.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
              In Satya-yuga, Lord Shiva revealed a great secret to his consort,
              Parvati. She had observed his ecstatic chanting of the name Gaura
              and his blissful dancing, and she inquired about the reason for
              his joy. Lord Shiva then spoke of the future advent of Sri
              Chaitanya in Navadvipa, describing how the golden-complexioned
              Lord would chant the Holy Names and spread devotion and divine
              love throughout the world. He explained that only the most
              unfortunate would fail to drown in this ocean of bliss. Even
              Mahadev himself could not contain his ecstasy upon hearing Sri
              Chaitanya’s name. Finally, he resolved to leave Kashi and come to
              Mayapur to engage in devotional service.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-space15 md:mt-space30">
              Hearing this revelation, Parvati Devi was also inspired to travel
              to Navadvipa. She arrived with great eagerness to offer obeisances
              to the Supreme Lord in His divine form as Sri Chaitanya and
              performed austerities to obtain His mercy. In due course, her
              devotion was rewarded—she was blessed with the vision of Sri
              Chaitanya. Overcome with ecstasy, she fell at His lotus feet and
              reverently placed their dust upon her forehead.

              Nanda Acharya Bhavan is the home of Nanda Acharya, a close associate of Sri Chaitanya. Sri Chaitanya met Nityananda Prabhu at this very place for the first time.  
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              One day, Sri Chaitanya understood that Nityananda had arrived in Navadvip. Overwhelmed with joy, He urged His devotees to find Him. But no one knew whom He was speaking about.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Gathering His associates, Chaitanya shared a dream He had the night before:
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              "I saw a chariot stop before my house, carrying an extraordinary personality. He wore blue cloth, a turban, and a single dazzling earring. A club rested on His shoulder, and a kamandalu pot hung from His stick. The moment I saw Him, I felt He was my brother—Balaram."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              "He asked repeatedly, ‘Is this the house of Nimai Pandit?’ Though I had never seen Him before, I was drawn to Him with deep reverence. I asked, ‘Who are You?’ He smiled and said, ‘I am Your brother. Tomorrow, we shall meet.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              "I believe a great soul has arrived in Navadvip. Haridas! Shrivas! Go find Him at once."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Haridas Thakur and Shrivas Pandit searched everywhere but found no one like the person Chaitanya described. After nine hours, they returned, exhausted: "We searched every corner of Navadvip but could not find Him."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Chaitanya smiled. "Nityananda is the embodiment of Sri Guru. He cannot be found unless Bhagavan Himself reveals Him."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Then, with all His devotees, Chaitanya set out in search of Nityananda. Chanting “Haribol! Haribol!”, they arrived at Nandana Acharya’s house.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              There, they saw Him. A divine jewel among men—lost in deep meditation, effulgent like a million suns. The moment Chaitanya beheld Him, He recognized His eternal brother, Balarama. Nityananda, too, saw His Lord.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Stunned with ecstasy, He gazed at Chaitanya with unwavering devotion—as if drinking Him with His eyes, smelling Him with His nose, embracing Him with His very soul. He stood motionless, silent.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Understanding this divine moment, Chaitanya asked Srivasa to recite a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (10.21.5):
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              "Wearing a peacock-feather ornament upon His head, blue karnikara flowers on His ears, a golden-yellow garment, and the Vaijayanti garland, Lord Krishna entered Vrindavan, filling the forest with the nectar of His flute…"
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Upon hearing this, Nityananda collapsed in divine ecstasy, losing all external awareness. As Shrivas recited more and more, His bliss intensified—He roared, tears streaming down His face.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              The Lord and His brother had reunited.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Today, this sacred site is home to a beautiful temple, established by Srila Bhakti Saranga Goswami Maharaj, a prominent disciple of Srila Prabhupad. Here, he installed the deities of Sri Sri Gaura-Nityananda, Sri Sri Radha Vinod Bihari, Sriman Sri Chaitanya, and Sri Narasimhadev.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Srila Bhakti Saranga Maharaj was a distinguished scholar, a brilliant orator, and an exceptional preacher. His deep wisdom and divine qualities made him a master at dispelling misconceptions and defending the mission of Sri Chaitanya. Recognizing his abilities, Srila Prabhupad often entrusted him with clarifying doubts and upholding the integrity of the Gaudiya mission—a task he fulfilled with great success.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-space15 md:mb-space30">
              Later, he became the editor of The Gaudiya magazine and was sent to London to spread the message of Sri Chaitanya, where his preaching made a lasting impact.
