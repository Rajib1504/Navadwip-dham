            <p>During ancient times, Parvati Devi came here to overcome her grief and despondency, performing meditation and austerities. As a result, she was granted the divine vision of Sri Chaitanya’s transcendental beauty. Overwhelmed with devotion, she placed the dust of His lotus feet on the central part of her hair—simanta—giving this island its name.</p>
            <p className="mt-space30">In Satya-yuga, Lord Shiva revealed a great secret to his consort, Parvati. She had observed his ecstatic chanting of the name Gaura and his blissful dancing, and she inquired about the reason for his joy. Lord Shiva then spoke of the future advent of Sri Chaitanya in Navadvipa, describing how the golden-complexioned Lord would chant the Holy Names and spread devotion and divine love throughout the world. He explained that only the most unfortunate would fail to drown in this ocean of bliss. Even Mahadev himself could not contain his ecstasy upon hearing Sri Chaitanya’s name. Finally, he resolved to leave Kashi and come to Mayapur to engage in devotional service.</p>
            <p className="mt-space30">Hearing this revelation, Parvati Devi was also inspired to travel to Navadvipa. She arrived with great eagerness to offer obeisances to the Supreme Lord in His divine form as Sri Chaitanya and performed austerities to obtain His mercy. In due course, her devotion was rewarded—she was blessed with the vision of Sri Chaitanya. Overcome with ecstasy, she fell at His lotus feet and reverently placed their dust upon her forehead.</p>
