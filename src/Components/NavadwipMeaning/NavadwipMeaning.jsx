It unfolds like a lotus. At its heart lies the birthplace of Sri Chaitanya, symbolizing self-surrender. From surrender, devotion blossoms—each petal of this lotus representing hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshipping, praying, servitorship, and friendship. As we journey through these sacred places, their stories reveal to us the essence of true devotion.</p>
